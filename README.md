This project utilized open source simulator CARLA to test and experiment autonomous vehicle controller design.  
- CARLA version used in this project is [V0.9.5](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases/tag/0.9.5) for Windows.  
- This CARLA version only works on [python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-375/). Make sure python 3.7 is installed.
- Please extract the carla folder inside /CARLA_0.9.5/PythonAPI/carla/dist/carla-0.9.5-py3.7-win-amd64.egg to your working directory or Python/Python37/Lib directory.
- Default server ip is "localhost" (or 127.0.0.1), port is 2000.
